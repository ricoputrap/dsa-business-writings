### What is Cohort Analysis?
Cohort analysis is a type of behavioral analytics, which is primarily identified by **breaking down customers** into related groups in order to gain **a better understanding of their behaviors** [(Gustafson, 2020)](https://www.lightercapital.com/blog/what-is-cohort-analysis/).

### Goals
Identify clear patterns across different customer groups and use that information to better identify problems, satisfy customersâ€™ needs, and design engagement strategies.

### Types
1. **Acquisition Cohort** - Pengelompokkan pelanggan berdasarkan kapan pelanggan bergabung/bertransaksi pertama kalinya.
2. **Behavioral Cohort** - Pengelompokkan pelanggan berdasarkan perilaku atau aksi yang dilakukannya ketika bertransaksi, salah satunya berdasarkan jenis produk yang dibelinya.

### Typical Questions
1. Do customers you acquired last month act differently than ones you signed up the month prior?
2. Do users who responded to a discount or promotion behave differently than those who purchased at full price?
